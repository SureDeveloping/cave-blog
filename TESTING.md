## Code validation
### HTML validation
The individual pages have been checked with the W3C validar. All errors could be fixed except for the pages where Sommernode was used. On these pages 11 errors were found that Sommernode causes. It is an external source over which I have no control. To fix these errors in the future it would be possible to find another text editor that does not cause errors.

### CSS Validator:
The base.cc file was tested using W3C Validator. No errors occurred.

### Python Validation
All python files created were tested with the CI Python Linter. The errors detected have been eliminated, so that all files are now error-free.

### Lighthouse test
Performance, accessibility, best practices and seo were tested using [lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) <br>
Overall, good values were achieved in the lighthouse test. However, it can be seen that the performance of the pages where Summernode was used is significantly worse than the pages without Summernode. On the pages with Summernode the value is between 68 and 71, on the other pages the worst value is 88. For this reason it is worth testing a different text editor in the future. <br>
With a blog, I don't have much influence on the content and therefore on the SEO value. The worst value is 83, which is still good, but it is difficult to improve it if you have little influence on the content. 
The values for accessibility and best practices are all in the very good range.

## Bugs
This was my first Django/database project, I mainly encountered learning curves and initial challenges. However, the bugs that I struggled with longer or that required the help of tutor support were a different category.

### Fixed known bugs
- A message should be displayed in the login view as a warning if the form is not sent correctly and the login fails. Unfortunately, these messages did not appear in the template. The error lay in the fact that I used two identical url ending for the django.contrib.auth.urls and for the accounts.urls. After changing one of the endings, the messages were displayed.
- I had not set WhitenoiseMiddleware to the second position in Middleware in the settings. Therefore this did not work properly. Despite this, I had already collected the tripod files beforehand. So django had created a staticfiles folder and heroko had worked with it. That's why I always had errors in the deployed version. With the help of the tutor support this could be uncovered. I deleted the old files and I collected those again.
- The Summernode were not resposive. The solution was to add some configurations to the settings file to fix this problem.

### Unfixed kown bugs
- I had several errors and difficulties with the processing of images and Cloudinary. Large images loaded very slowly and slowed everything down. Here should be provided that the large is limited. <br>
I also had errors in the Deployed version with the API (supply api key). So I made a mistake when setting up Cloudinary. <br>
I had already started but noticed that it has effects many other parts of my program. I didn't want to jeopardize the stability of the program, so close to the release. This should be fixed for the next realise. To do this, it makes sense to start setting up cloudanary from the beginning. For this reason, it is not yet possible to upload images to profiles and blog posts.
- As described above, Summernode causes html errors and slows down the performance of the corresponding pages. An alternative text editor could offer a solution in the future.
