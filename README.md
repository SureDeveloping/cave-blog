# ReadME - Project Instruction
Portfolio Project 4 – User SureDeveloping – Code Institute
## Introduction
"The website is a blog focused on caves. It's a place where cave enthusiasts can share their experiences by creating posts. Users can also comment on each other's posts. To get started, users need to set up a user accont. The blog is meant to be a space for like-minded individuals to connect, share experiences, and offer tips and advice for future cave visits.<br>
